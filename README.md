# WID2003 — Cognitive Science Practical Project
## Predicting Cognitive Processing Style from Eye-Tracking During Visual Search Tasks

**Course:** WID2003 Cognitive Science 

**Faculty:** Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FSKTM), Universiti Malaya

---

## Overview

This project integrates three areas of cognitive science into a single end-to-end analysis:

| Domain | What we use it for |
|---|---|
| **Cognitive Science** | Understanding how attention and visual search work |
| **Eye-Tracking** | Measuring gaze behaviour objectively (Tobii Pro Lab) |
| **Machine Learning** | Classifying participants as high vs. low performers |

Participants completed **8 visual search tasks** while their eye movements were recorded. The goal is to build a classifier that predicts whether a student is a **high-performing** or **low-performing** problem solver based solely on their gaze patterns — without needing to know their answer.

---

## Research Question

> Can eye-tracking features captured during visual search tasks predict whether a student belongs to the high-performing or low-performing group?

**Hypothesis:** High-performing students will show more efficient visual attention — shorter time to the target area, higher dwell time on the correct region, and fewer unnecessary fixations on distractors.

---

## Visual Search Tasks

All 8 tasks are shown as full-screen images. Participants are timed and observed.

| Task | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `findDice` | Find the dice hidden among food items | Find object |
| `findYummy` | Find the hidden word "YUMMY" in a pizza restaurant scene | Find word |
| `frogInBathroom` | Spot the frog hidden inside a bathroom scene | Find object |
| `headphoneInBathroom` | Spot the headphones hidden in a bathroom | Find object |
| `frog` | Identify the frog that is different from all others | Spot the odd one |
| `whoCheats` | Identify which student is cheating in the classroom | Identify who |
| `whoThief` | Identify the thief in a crowd scene | Identify who |
| `spotNeedleInst` | Spot the needle hidden in the scene | Find object |

Each task has a set of labelled **Areas of Interest (AOIs)** defined in Tobii Pro Lab:
- `answer` — the correct target region
- `M1`, `M2`, ... — distractor regions

## Setup

### 1. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv wid2003_venv
source wid2003_venv/bin/activate        # Linux / macOS
wid2003_venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch Jupyter

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the `notebooks/` folder and run the notebooks in order (01 → 07).

---


## Pipeline Execution Order

Run the notebooks **in this exact sequence**. Each notebook depends on the outputs of the previous one.

```
01_data_preprocessing
        ↓
02_feature_extraction
        ↓
03_label_creation
        ↓
04_dataset_creation
       ↙ ↘
05_exploratory   06_prediction_models
```

| Step | Notebook | Time estimate |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `01_data_preprocessing` | ~2 min (loads 31 MB file) |
| 2 | `02_feature_extraction` | ~5 min |
| 3 | `03_label_creation` | < 1 min |
| 4 | `04_dataset_creation` | < 1 min |
| 5 | `05_exploratory_analysis` | ~2 min |
| 6 | `06_prediction_models` | ~5–10 min (cross-validation) |

## Data Files

You can download the raw data files (`student_responses.csv`, `VisualTask_Data_export.tsv`, and `VisualTask_Metrics.tsv`) from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a6jgH7E-a9mUzhoJyLGDlW8e7_VGAhAw?usp=sharing).

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `data/raw/VisualTask_Metrics.tsv` | Pre-aggregated eye-tracking metrics per AOI per participant (Tobii Pro Lab export) |
| `data/raw/VisualTask_Data_export.tsv` | Raw gaze point data at full sampling rate (~30 MB) |
| `data/raw/student_responses.csv` | Manual response accuracy per participant per task (1 = correct, 0 = incorrect) |
| `data/external/task_correct_aoi_map.json` | Maps each task to its correct AOI (`answer`/`answer1`) and distractors (`M1`–`M15`, `aoi1`–`aoi9`) |
| `data/external/answer_key.json` | Confirms the correct AOI and task type for each stimulus |

## Key Concepts

### Areas of Interest (AOIs)
Rectangular regions drawn on the stimulus image in Tobii Pro Lab. In this study, each task has:
- **`answer`** (or **`answer1`** for `frogInBathroom`) — the region containing the target (what the participant is looking for)
- **`M1`–`M15`** — distractor regions (wrong areas)
- **`aoi1`–`aoi9`** — distractor regions used in `findYummy`

#### Exporting AOIs and Stimuli
To export the AOI file (`.aois`) and the stimulus image annotated with AOIs (`.png`) from Tobii Pro Lab:
- Go to **Analyse** drop-down menu > **AOI Tool**. 
- Select the image/snapshot/stimulus in the AOI Visualization that you wish to export.
- Right-click on the image/snapshot/stimulus.

**For exporting the image (`.png`):**
- Click **Export Image** in the context menu.
- In the Save As dialogue, enter a file name in the File name input field.
- Navigate to the folder into which you want to save the image and click **Save**.

**For exporting the AOIs (`.aois`):**
1. Open the AOI Tool from the Analyze drop-down list at the top of Pro Lab.
2. Select the media in the Media Selection panel.
3. Right-click the media in the main viewer and select **Export AOIs**.
4. Save the file.
*(Note: When no AOIs exist, the Export option is disabled.)*

### Eye-Tracking Features
Metrics recorded per AOI per participant:

| Feature | Cognitive meaning |
|---|---|
| Time to first fixation on `answer` | How quickly the participant detected the target |
| Total fixation duration on `answer` | How long they focused on the correct region |
| Number of visits to `answer` | How many times they returned to the target |
| Distractor dwell ratio | Proportion of time spent on wrong regions |
| Scanpath length | Total distance the eye traveled |
| Pupil diameter change | Proxy for cognitive load over time |

### Classification Labels
Participants are split into two groups using a **median split** on their accuracy score:
- **High-performing (1):** Accuracy at or above the group median
- **Low-performing (0):** Accuracy below the group median

## Group Roles

During data collection, group members rotate through these roles:

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Eye-tracker operator | Runs recordings in Tobii Pro Lab, manages calibration |
| Participant manager | Welcomes participants, explains the task |
| Response recorder | Notes each participant's response (found / not found) |
| Data recorder | Enters responses into `student_responses.csv` |
| Observer | Monitors data quality, notes any tracking issues |
